# emacs-config
The *zenburn theme* package can be found [here](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs)\
The rest of the stuff is configured for **Python** at the moment.\
Edit: I am also adding my terminal (zsh) configuration here, since I have a habit of tweaking it regularly till I see something that I like (albeit a rarity).
