# Basic Configs
-The *zenburn theme* package can be found [here](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs)\
-The configuration is currently for **Python** and **LaTeX** (AucTeX).\
-I have added the "evil mode" package in emacs just because some of the default key bindings in Vim are faster than those in emacs (switch between the two by ```C-z```)
