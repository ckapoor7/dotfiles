# Basic Configs
In a surprising turn of events, I accidentally deleted some of the source packages of emacs which completely screwed somethings up. This made me want to explore a better avenue of package management that was arguably painful at times in emacs (sometimes due to being **unstable and deprecated** or random dependencies which were missing). All of this led me to a much cleaner and sane distro: **Doom emacs**.\
Other than being *much* faster than vanilla emacs, installing and configuring packages is a breeze. By default, ```VIM``` key-bindings are enabled as part of the **evil-mode**, many of which are better than the emacs ones (especially cursor navigation). Switiching to the default emacs bindings is as simple as doing ```C-z```.\
Another really great feauture that got me was the version control system (```magit```), which is a "*porcelain* ```git```". Files are tracked locally which eases workflow quite a bit.\
I have left the old emacs configuration in this repository for sentimental purposes (I guess?) or maybe in the very **rare** event where I would want to revert back to this (although unlikely).
